### Create a Composition Helper Tool for Melody and Harmony Building

**Description:**  
To empower users with easy-to-use tools for creating music, we aim to develop a composition helper module featuring:
1. A drag-and-drop interface for arranging chords.  
2. Real-time playback engine for previewing compositions.  
3. A save-and-reuse functionality for user projects.

**Technical Goals:**  
- Build React-based components for UI includes drag-and-drop gesture inputs.  
- Integrate sound playback via MIDI or Web Audio API.  
- Set up functionality for saving and reloading user-created compositions.

**Next Steps:**  
- Assemble wireframes for the interface design and user flow.  
- Implement real-time audio preview for chord sequences.  
- Ensure extensibility for future features like lyrics integration.
