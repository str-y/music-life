  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: 24 February 2026</p>

  <p>
    Music Life ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application for iOS
    and Android that helps musicians tune instruments, practise, and analyse
    chords. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect
    information when you use the app.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Audio Data</h2>
  <p>
    Music Life uses your device's microphone <strong>solely for real-time
    pitch detection and chord analysis</strong>. Audio is processed entirely
    on-device and is <strong>never recorded, stored, or transmitted</strong>
    to any server or third party. The app does not retain any audio samples
    after each analysis frame is processed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Microphone access is requested only when you open the Tuner or Chord
    Analyser screen and is released as soon as you leave that screen.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Audio recordings or microphone samples</li>
    <li>Personal identification information (name, email, etc.)</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
    <li>Usage analytics or crash reports sent to third-party services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The app stores your in-app preferences (e.g., dark mode, reference pitch
    calibration, practice log entries) in local device storage using the
    platform's standard secure storage APIs. This data never leaves your
    device and is removed when you uninstall the app.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The app requests the following permissions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Microphone</strong> – required for pitch detection and chord
      analysis. Access is used only while the relevant screen is active.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can revoke microphone permission at any time in your device settings.
    Revoking it disables pitch detection and chord analysis features.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Music Life does not integrate any third-party SDKs that collect personal
    data (e.g., no advertising networks, no analytics services, no social-
    login libraries).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Music Life does not knowingly collect personal information from children
    under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). Because the app
    collects no personal data at all, it is safe to use by all age groups.
  </p>

  <h2>7. GDPR &amp; Rights of Users in the EEA</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect personal data, there is no data to access,
    rectify, erase, or port. If you have questions about your rights under
    the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you may contact us at
    the address below.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated"
    date at the top of this page will reflect any changes. Continued use of
    the app after a change constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
